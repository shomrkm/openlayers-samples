# OpenLayers Samples with React + TypeScript

I like both [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). While OpenLayers can be more challenging to begin with than Leaflet, it offers a wider range of functionality.  

Although the official OpenLayers page provides numerous [examples](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/), some may be difficult to apply when used with React + TypeScript.  

This repository is intended to share sample code for using OpenLayers with React + TypeScript.

You can view a page from this repository deployed on Vercel below.
